I used to think I couldn't be without you, be without you
Now that you're gone, I feel happy as hell (KSI, Nathan Dawe, ah)

When you said it was over
I knew I'd fallen too deep
You made my world feel perfect
Then pulled it from under my feet

I cried for a minute
For a while I was trying to figure out what went wrong
Yeah
Now I finally get it
And I see I don't need you to be here, I'm moving on

I used to think I couldn't be without you, be without you
Now that you're gone, I feel happy as hell
Weight off of me, I can breathe without you, breathe without you
Now that you're gone, I feel lighter

I used to think I couldn't be without you, be without you
Now that you're gone, I feel happy as hell
Weight off of me, I can breathe without you, breathe without you
Now that you're gone, I feel lighter

I'm feeling so good, like a fat man with a pengting
Feeling so high like a black Yao Ming
Call me Godzilla 'cause I got a big part
Went through war, got a Purple Heart
Needed my space, time, recovery
Now man's ace, quick summary
New discovery, losin' that weight
Post on the 'Gram 'cause I'm just bait
I'm way too slick with it
John Wick with it
I'm takin' bare shots in a quick minute
More drinks with it
Bare sick with it
Still end up in a bed with a chick in it
VVS1 on my chain, bust down
Been through a lot, now man's got a crown
KSI verified, stay schemin', start believin'
You know I

I used to think I couldn't be without you, be without you
Now that you're gone, I feel happy as hell
Weight off of me, I can breathe without you, breathe without you
Now that you're gone, I feel lighter

I used to think I couldn't be without you, be without you
Now that you're gone, I feel happy as hell
Weight off of me, I can breathe without you, breathe without you
Now that you're gone, I feel lighter

I cried for a minute
For a while I was trying to figure out what went wrong
Now I finally get it
And I see I don't need you to be here, I'm moving on

I used to think I couldn't be without you, be without you
Now that you're gone, I feel happy as hell
Weight off of me, I can breathe without you, breathe without you
Now that you're gone, I feel lighter

Gone, I feel lighter
You're gone, I feel lighter
You're gone, I feel lighter
You're gone, I feel lighter

Gone, I feel lighter
You're gone, I feel lighter

Now that you're gone, I feel lighter
