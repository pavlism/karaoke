Call me raider, call me wrong, call me insane, call me Mr. Vain
Call me what you like as long as you call me, time and again
Feel the presence of the aura of the man, none to compare
Lovely time for a chance just to touch your hand or a moment to share
Can't deny the urge, that makes them want to lose themselves to the debonair one
Hold me back, the simple fact is that I'm all that, and I'm always near
One sexy can't perplex me now you know who's raw as if you didn't know before
I know what I want, and I want it now, I want you, and then I want a little more

Yeah

Girls all over the world they hope, and pray, and die for men like me
Cause I'm the one, begotten son that breaks the mold, get a look at male epitome
Style has never seen that makes you want to grab, and hold, and squeeze real tight
Who's gonna be the one to save you from yourself when you wanna take a bite
Please, oh baby, please, you beg, you want, you say, you got to get some
Caught up in the charm, that I laid on thick and now there's nowhere to run
Just another fish to pick the worm on the hook of my line, yeah, I keep many
Females longing for a chance to win my heart with S.E.X. and plenty
