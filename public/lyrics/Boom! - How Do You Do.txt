How do you do
You like me and I like you
Come and take me by the hand
'Cause I wanna be your friend

How do you do
You like me and I like you
Say how do you do you do

When I'm going on a summer holiday
And my plane leaves to a place so far away
I'm so happy 'cause its time to celebrate
Oh, I feel like I could dance, ooh whoa

Different people all around the globe don't know
What to say when there's a stranger I will show
That there is a way you can communicate
Everybody understands

How do you do
You like me and I like you
Come and take me by the hand
'Cause I wanna be your friend
How do you do
You like me and I like you
Say how do you do you do
How do you do you do

You like me and I like you
Come and take me by the hand
'Cause I wanna be your friend

You like me and I like you
Say how do you do you do

It's so easy when you want to make a friend
When the sun is shining in a distant land
There's a certain feeling that surrounds your mind
And you feel like you can dance, ooh whoa

When you're going to the south of Africa
To America or to Australia
You'll see people of all colors and all kinds
Everybody understands

How do you do
You like me and I like you
Come and take me by the hand
'Cause I wanna be your friend
How do you do
You like me and I like you
Say how do you do you do
