Yeah go
One Love .. One Love
Ay it's the king speaking
TIP right here hollerin' at my homeboy Enrique
What we need you right now
We need all the ladies around the world man to do what you know how to do for us one time
We watchin'

[Enrique:]
Girl please excuse me
If I'm coming too strong
But tonight is the night
We can really let go
My girlfriend is out of town
And I'm all alone
Your boyfriend is on vacation
And he doesn't have to know
No oh oh, oh oh
No one can do the things I'm gonna wanna do to you
No oh oh, oh oh
Shout aloud, screamin loud
Let me hear you go!

Baby I like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby I like it
Come on and give me some more
Oh yes I like it
Screaming like never before
Baby I like it
I, I, I like it

Party, Karamu, Fiesta, Forever

Girl please excuse me
If I'm misbehaving, oh
I'm trying keep my hands off
But you're begging me for more
Round round round
Give a low low low
Let the time time pass
'Cause we're never getting old
No oh oh, oh oh
No one can do it better turn around I'll give you more
No oh oh, oh oh
Shout aloud, screamin loud
Let me hear you go!

Baby I like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby I like it
Come on and give me some more
Oh yes I like it
Screaming like never before
Baby I like it
I, I, I like it

[T.I.:]
Here we go
Volcano flow there is no hotter
Even tho you got her still better watch her
For real if I like her I'll taker her first date her and erase her
Out of my phone I won't chase her
Just give me a funny run and I'll chase her
More seats when I'm hosting the Lakers
All I wanna hear is whatever you say sir
Swagga man so much flavor
Lake front stay on acres
I'll take you're girl to a pearl than I lase her
Than get straight chicks maker her taste her
Hard to say this the road of the paper
They keep broads coming back like acres
Land of Jamaica, wrist full of glaciers
Than Herbies in mystery places

[Enrique:]
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby
Just keep on shaking along
I won't stop baby, won't stop baby
Until you get enough

Party, Karamu, Fiesta, Forever

Screaming like never before
Baby I like it! I, I, I like it!

The way you move on the floor
Baby I like it!

Screaming like never before
Baby I like it! I, I, I like it!
