I've been seein' lonely people in crowded rooms
Coverin' their old heartbreaks with new tattoos
It's all about smokescreens and cigarettes
Lookin' through low lights at silhouettes
But all I see is lonely people in crowded rooms

This city's gonna break my heart
This city's gonna love me, then leave me alone
This city's got me chasin' stars
It's been a couple months since I felt like I'm home
Am I gettin' closer to knowin' where I belong?
This city's gonna break my heart
She's always gonna break your heart, oh

I remember mornings when my head didn't hurt
And I remember nights when art didn't feel like work
She wakes up at noon and she's out 'til three
She leaves her perfume all over me
But I remember mornings when my head didn't hurt

This city's gonna break my heart
This city's gonna love me, then leave me alone
This city's got me chasin' stars
It's been a couple months since I felt like I'm home
Am I gettin' closer to knowin' where I belong?
This city's gonna break my heart
She's always gonna break your heart

She got a hold on me
She got me wrapped round her finger
She got a hold on me
She got me wrapped round her finger, oh yeah

This city's gonna break my heart
This city's gonna love me, then leave me alone
This city's got me chasin' stars
It's been a couple months since I felt like I'm home
Am I gettin' closer to knowin' where I belong?
This city's gonna break my heart
She's always gonna break your heart

This city's gonna break my heart, hey
She's always gonna break your heart
