I'm lucky if I ever see the light of day again
My skin is choking me, my feeble walls are closing in
This cell is filled with scholars easing me, they're teasing me
They told me so I didn't know the fall would be this easy

How long until it starts to do me in
I can’t give out what I’m not breathing in
I know they'll come with what I'm owed, guilty as charged
My enemies belittle me reminding me the penalty of all my deeds despite my pleas is death

Don't let go ’cause I don't wanna be this, I don't wanna be this
Death is mine I know
Don't let go, don't let go
Save your own ’cause I don't wanna be this, I don't wanna be this
Death is mine I know
Don't let go, don't let go, savior

Your way to life has only showed me what a fool I am
It serves the purpose of confirming I remain condemned
And I will ever linger on the edge
Unless you hear me

How long until it starts to do me in
I can’t give out what I’m not breathing in
I know they'll come with what I'm owed, guilty as charged
My enemies belittle me reminding me the penalty of all my deeds despite my pleas is death

Don't let go ’cause I don't wanna be this, I don't wanna be this
Death is mine I know
Don't let go, don't let go
Save your own ’cause I don't wanna be this, I don't wanna be this
Death is mine I know
Don't let go, don't let go, savior

Don't let go ’cause I don't wanna be this, I don't wanna be this
Death is mine I know
Don't let go, don't let go
Save your own ’cause I don't wanna be this, I don't wanna be this
Death is mine I know
Don't let go, don't let go, save your own
