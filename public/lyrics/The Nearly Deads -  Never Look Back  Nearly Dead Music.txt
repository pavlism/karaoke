Got a mouth full of words,
But nothing to say
If you could've seen
How I looked yesterday
A hopeless disaster
But I'm getting better
At being faster

Is there any other way
To live your life
Than to throw it all way
And cut the ties?
Were they really holding us
In place to begin with?

Who are you judging anyway?
It's my neck on the line

Say goodbye to everything
Forget your regrets
They're better left behind
Say goodbye to whispering uncertainty
What's holding us back
Is keeping us alive.

Shut your mouth
And start to believe
Oh excuses, excuses
That I don't need,
If it's me you're after
Well, how about a straight answer?

We don't have all the day
We don't have all year
Put it into one
And out the other ear
Were you ever listening at all?

Who are you judging anyway?
It's my neck on the line

Say goodbye to everything
Forget your regrets
They're better left behind
Say goodbye to whispering uncertainty
What's holding us back
Is keeping us alive, alive

Never look back, don't doubt tomorrow
Never look back, don't doubt tomorrow
Never look back, don't doubt tomorrow
Never look back, don't doubt tomorrow

Say goodbye to everything
Forget your regrets
They're better left behind
Say goodbye to whispering uncertainty
The only thing that holds us back
The only thing that holds us back
The only thing that's keeping us alive.

Oh, it's the only thing that's keeping us alive.
