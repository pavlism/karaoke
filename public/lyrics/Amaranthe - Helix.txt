I can't stop you from breathing
Give it all and then see you leave it
I will stand and defeat it
Undertow, stuck in the middle

Lift the veil of the darkness
Be the voice of the broken hearted
Just like you, I unleashed it all
To reverse my heartbeat

All the voices in my mind
And the times that we denied
As I will reach into the light
We cannot get out of

Make a start with the Helix
Take us through the tide
You can hide in this feeling
I know we can see it
All the stars are right
Set my heart in the Phoenix
Until the end of time
So forgive us
For sinning
Make a start with the Helix

Nothing you say, how much you pay
Never making me stop
And every time you complained
You were bringing me up
And now you come around begging
Now I'm at the top
You'd better pray I never break
Because you are draining my cup

Found my way through your eden
I can see the soul-seeking pathway
Scream for help if you need me
I'm prepared to receive the heathens

All the voices in my mind
And the times that we denied
We come to the end of the line
We cannot get out of

Make a start with the Helix
Take us through the tide
You can hide in this feeling
I know we can see it
All the stars are right
Set my heart in the Phoenix
Until the end of time
So forgive us
For sinning
Make a start with the Helix

(Close your eyes, and open your mind)

How much I paid to get to the top
And how I built from bottom up
And now I know I had to come back
This is a vision of the future not a flashback

Make a start with the Helix
Take us through the tide
You can hide in this feeling
I know we can see it
All the stars are right
Set my heart in the Phoenix
Until the end of time
So forgive us
For sinning
Make a start with the Helix

Nothing you say, how much you pay
Never making me stop
And every time you complained
You were bringing me up
And now you come around begging
Now I'm at the top
You'd better pray I never break
Because you are draining my cup
