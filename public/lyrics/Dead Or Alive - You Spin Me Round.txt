I don't wanna know your name.
And I do want your private number, baby.
All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your loving arms
Hear what's up, what's up.

I set my sights on you (and no one else will do)
And I have got to have my way now, baby
All I know is that to me
You look like you're having fun
Open up your loving arms
Watch out, here I come

You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round round round

You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round round round

I don't wanna be your friend now, baby
But I. I wanna move it just a little bit closer

All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your loving arms
Watch out, here I come

You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round round round

You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round round round

All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your loving arms
Watch out, here I come

You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round round round

You spin me right round, baby
Right round like a record, baby
Right round round round
