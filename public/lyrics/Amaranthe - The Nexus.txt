Right now
I wanna be the enemy
I hide
Empower our remedy

Step up
Get your game on
Get your pride back
Never back down, oh

And as I open my eyes
I see my shadow
Will I return like my self or parted atoms

I have the will inside my mind
(Inside my mind)
There is a voice I can't deny

I break with the past
Set the nexus free at last
As the future will be there to save us
Trapped in my skin
See the nexus in my dreams
But will you bury me within

Yeah, I rise so you can be a part of me
I hide as part of the machinery

I've stepped on the wires
Feeding the flames to burn higher-er

And as the darkness reveals
I see no reason
For me to reach for the cure
I'm my own demon

I kept the secrets in my mind
There is a voice I can't deny

I break with the past
Set the nexus free at last
As the future will be there to save us
Trapped in my skin
See the nexus in my dreams
But will you bury me within

Face it down
I'm the spine in the flame
Just let it out of me
Break it out of the core
To help me breathe

I have the will inside my mind
There is a voice I can't deny

I break with the past
Set the nexus free at last
As the future will be there to save us
Trapped in my skin
See the nexus in my dreams
But will you bury me within
