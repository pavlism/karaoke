Down down, buried beneath
I feel like I'm running out of time, running out of time
Down down, make me believe
I want you to show me I'm alive, show me I'm alive

I have seen the slow disaster
Wreckage of my life
Silence before and nothing after
Echoing inside, I confess

I lied for this
I died for this

Down, down, buried beneath (down, down)
I feel like I'm running out of time, running out of time
Down, down, make me believe (down, down)
I want you to show me I'm alive, show me I'm alive

Life, life, life

I am just a sole survivor
Of self inflicted wounds
Shadows hide the dying embers
Burning out too soon

I lied for this
I died for this

Down, down, buried beneath (down, down)
I feel like I'm running out of time, running out of time
Down, down, make me believe (down, down)
I want you to show me I'm alive, show me I'm alive

Show me, show me down
Show me, show me down
Down, down
Buried

Down, down, buried beneath (down, down)
I feel like I'm running out of time, running out of time
Down, down, make me believe (down, down)
I want you to show me I'm alive, show me I'm alive

I lied for this (down, down, buried beneath)
I died for this (down, down buried beneath)
Down, down, buried beneath (down, down)
I feel like I'm running out of time, show me I'm alive
