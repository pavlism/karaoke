When i see you, I get blown away
Something inside me is taking over
I start st-st-st-stuttering; can't find the words to say
I feel the opposite of sober

It's what you do to me
Got me saying yeah, yeah, yeah
It's like I'm in a dream
And when I wake up I hope that you're still here with me

All I ever wanted was a one life stand
I could spend forever in a moment like this
All I ever wanted was a one life stand
So take me away

Ooooh
we got one life, we got one heart
Oooh

I'm so weightless, I can touch the sky
It's like we're on a rollercoaster
My body's aching
And you're the reason why
Why don't you come a little closer

It's what you do to me
Got me saying yeah, yeah, yeah
It's like I'm in a dream
And when I wake up I hope that you're still here with me

So take me away

All I ever wanted was a one life stand
I could spend forever in a moment like this
All I ever wanted was a one life stand
So take me away
So take me away
