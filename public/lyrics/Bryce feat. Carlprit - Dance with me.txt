Somebody dance with me

Somebody dance with me

We hit the dance floor
Looking for models
Me 'n my home crew
We popping bottles
Tonight's a good night
And that's the reason
We trying to scrub it down
I got this feelings
Let's go

Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me

Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me
I got this feelings
Somebody dance with me

Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me

Somebody dance with me
Somebody dance with me
I got this feeling
I got this feeling
I got this feeling
Tonight is the party
So we can roll out
And flip the party
We raid an old wick
Just for one reason
And that's the party
I got this feeling
Let's go
I got this feeling
I got this feeling
