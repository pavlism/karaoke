Baby, baby tell me more of your lies

Hurt and pain
Still not enough to let go
Have you felt this way
Is there a cure to endure this deathless woe
Will I fall and break
Or will true love prevail
I'm on the edge

How much longer
Can I hold on?

Baby, baby tell me more of your lies
Say you want me for a lifetime
I believe you even when I know it's a lie
Love's so blind
Sweet true lies

Sorrowbound
I cried all hope into exile
And the monsters prowl
Behind every window and door in my dismal mind
It's the darkest hour
Emotional self-slaughter
Of what's remained

Faith torn asunder
I am burning alive

Baby, baby tell me more of your lies
Say you want me for a lifetime
I believe you even when I know it's a lie
Love's so blind
Sweet true lies

Faith torn asunder
I am burning alive

Baby, baby tell me more of your lies
Say you want me for a lifetime
I believe you even when I know it's a lie
Love's so blind, whoah oh

Baby, baby tell me more of your lies
Say you want me for a lifetime
I believe you even when I know it's a lie
Love's so blind
Sweet true lies, yeah

Sweet true lies
