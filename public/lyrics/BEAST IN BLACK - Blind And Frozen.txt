Once I touched your heart
Held you in closed arms
Built a haven for your love
Until I let you fall apart
Please forgive me

God I miss you like hell
I was wrong I can tell
For the heart can be blind and frozen
Now I live with the pain
Every night, every day
As I read those letters you wrote me

How I long for the time
When your lips would kiss mine
And the promise was still unbroken
I will wait for tomorrow
That may never come
I will wait in the name of love

My forlorn heart faintly beats
Your absence makes me weak
And if nothing brings you back
Surely I'll roam through life in black
Like a shadow

God I miss you like hell
I was wrong I can tell
For the heart can be blind and frozen
Now I live with the pain
Every night, every day
As I read those letters you wrote me

How I long for the time
When your lips would kiss mine
And the promise was still unbroken
I will wait for tomorrow
That may never come
I will wait in the name of love

I would die for the love of Mercy
Destiny, is this how it should be?
No no no

God I miss you like hell
I was wrong I can tell
For the heart can be blind and frozen
Now I live with the pain
Every night, every day
As I read those letters you wrote me

God I miss you like hell
I was wrong I can tell
For the heart can be blind and frozen
Now I live with the pain
Every night, every day
As I read those letters you wrote me

How I long for the time
When your lips would kiss mine
And the promise was still unbroken
I will wait for tomorrow
That may never come
I will wait in the name of love
