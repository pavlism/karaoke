A passing life each day, a carving on the wall
It's like a night without awakening
The truth is lost and maybe never to be found
Like the shadows of my pantomime

When all the world is gathered for the final feast
Will there be someone to believe in me?
Voices echoing in my distorted mind
Is this for real or just a dream?
(Am I losing my mind? I am not afraid, my dear)

Sing for me angel of afterlife calming me down
Chaos inside my nebula
And may the wrong turn to right in a celestial light
Forgive my sacrimony

Tell me what they say that I'm supposed to know
Tell me every little detail
Make truth appear for me as distant memories
Like pictures on a silver screen

It all becomes clear
The truth will appear
Forever a debt for you and me

Sing for me angel of afterlife calming me down
Chaos inside my nebula
And may the wrong turn to right in a celestial light
Forgive my sacrimony

Tell me what they say that I'm supposed to know
Tell me every little detail
Make truth appear for me as distant memories
Like pictures on a silver screen

And now leave me alone
Erase my memory
Don't want to hear, don't want to see
Don't want to think about the lie that follows me

It all becomes clear but no one will hear my testimony

I am your angel of afterlife calming you down
Silence inside your nebula
And when the wrong turns to right in a celestial light
I'll be your testimony

Sing for me angel of afterlife calming me down
Chaos inside my nebula
And may the wrong turn to right in a celestial light
Forgive my sacrimony

Tell me what they say that I'm supposed to know
Tell me every little detail
Make truth appear for me as distant memories
Like pictures on a silver screen

(Ring around a rosie
A pocketful of posies
Ashes, ashes
We all fall down)
