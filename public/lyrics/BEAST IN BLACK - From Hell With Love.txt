Here I am, Where all this began
A night that would not die, Left me sleepless

Caught in the timeless, Tale of you and I

Memories painful, Turned into baleful
Blackness in my heart, Killed my light
To serve your delight, Now see me ripped apart
Ripped apart

Another voiceless cry
Another hopeless try
I wish you'd open your wings
And take me inside
From hell with love I write
Confess my passion crime
'Cause to my heart, soul and mind
You are kryptonite, oh babe

Lovelorn soldier, Seeking a closure
To his vague crusade, Silenced by the
Heartless and violent

Mother of all pain, All pain

Another voiceless cry
Another hopeless try
I wish you'd open your wings and take me inside
From hell with love I write
Confess my passion crime
'Cause to my heart, soul and mind
You are kryptonite, whoa

Another voiceless cry
Another hopeless try
I wish you'd open your wings and take me inside
From hell with love I write
Confess my passion crime
'Cause to my heart, soul and mind
You are kryptonite

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I wish you'd open your wings and take me inside
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
'Cause to my heart, soul and mind
You are kryptonite, oh babe
