Stand up all the night and call the fight
Let your mind go wild before the light
Here we come, the army of the night

Mater Maria!

Lined up side by side and bound to pray
Sent to die and fight the final day
Army of the night, we came to stay

Mater Maria!

Better you pray before the night is falling
Call on the heaven sent, amen
Follow the night, it's your messiah calling
Bring on the sacrament, amen
Come to the other side, into the dark we hide

Gather them for the rite, sacristarum
We are the force allied, into the war we ride, hallelujah!
Stand up all the night and call the fight
Let your mind go wild before the light
Here we come, the army of the night

Mater Maria!

Lined up side by side and bound to pray
Sent to die and fight the final day
Army of the night, we came to stay

Mater Maria!

Enemies falling when the sermon spoken
Taken by higher hand, amen
Hallow the martyrs when the Bible broken
Summon the testament, amen
Come to the other side, into the dark we hide

Gather them for the rite, sacristarum
We are the force allied, into the war we ride, hallelujah!
Stand up all the night and call the fight
Let your mind go wild before the light
Here we come, the army of the night

Mater Maria!

Lined up side by side and bound to pray
Sent to die and fight the final day
Army of the night, we came to stay

Mater Maria!

Stand up all the night and call the fight
Let your mind go wild before the light
Here we come, the army of the night

Mater Maria!

Sanctify the night for all the time
Break the bread and raise the holy wine
Army of the night, go walk the line

Mater Maria!
