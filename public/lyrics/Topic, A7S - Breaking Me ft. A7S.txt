Call me what you wanna
I'll be what you wanna
I've been here a thousand times
Eh eh
Fallin' for another
I don't even bother
I could do it all my life

So tell me if you wanna
'Cause I got this feeling
I wanna hear you say it
Cause I can't believe it
With every touch of you
It's like I've started dreaming
Guess heaven's not that far away

And I'll be singing
La la la la, la la la la
You're breaking me
La la la la, la la la la
You're breaking me
La la la la, la la la la
You're breaking me
La la la la, la la la la

I'm just right here dancing around to the rhythm
The rhythm that you play when you're breaking my heart
You know that I can't get you out of my system
Yeah right from the start you played with my heart

And I'll be singing
La la la la, la la la la
You're breaking me
La la la la, la la la la
You're breaking me
La la la la, la la la la
You're breaking me
La la la la, la la la la
You're breaking me

You can do whatever
I'll be here forever
Spinning 'round inside this room
Eh eh
Won't you come on over
I'm a sucker for ya
Wishing we'll be out here soon

So tell me if you wanna
'Cause I got this feeling
I wanna hear you say it
Cause I can't believe it
With every touch of you
It's like I've started dreaming
Guess heaven's not that far away

And I'll be singing
La la la la, la la la la
You're breaking me
La la la la, la la la la
You're breaking me
La la la la, la la la la
You're breaking me
La la la la, la la la la

I'm just right here dancing around to the rhythm
The rhythm that you play when you're breaking my heart
You know that I can't get you out of my system
Yeah right from the start you played with my heart

And I'll be singing
La la la la, la la la la
You're breaking me
La la la la, la la la la
You're breaking me
La la la la, la la la la
You're breaking me
La la la la, la la la la
You're breaking me
