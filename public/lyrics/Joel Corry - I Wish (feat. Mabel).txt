Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

I wish, I wish I could hear you say my name
I wish, I wish we could do it all again
I wish, I wish I didn't have myself to blame
It's you I miss, yeah

'Cause when I look back at us, I know we almost had it, oh
But the time wasn't right, I should've loved you more
But there's no going back
Still I need you to know that
I'm not who I was before, no

I think of you every day, every night
You said you needed space and you needed time
And I want you to know what I did wasn't right
Wish I could change your mind
I wish, I wish

I wish, I wish I didn't say goodbye so fast
I wish, I wish I could take the moment back
I wish, I wish I'd cherished everything we had
But it's you I miss

'Cause when I look back at us, I know we almost had it, oh
But the time wasn't right, I should've loved you more
But there's no going back
Still I need you to know that
I'm not who I was before, no

I think of you every day, every night
You said you needed space and you needed time
And I want you to know what I did wasn't right
Wish I could change your mind
I wish, I wish

Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Wish I could change your mind
I wish, I wish

It's not much I'm asking, baby (Not much)
What I gotta do for you to believe me?
If a second chance sounds crazy
Then I don't know how I'm gonna be

I think of you every day, every night
You said you needed space and you needed time
And I want you to know what I did wasn't right
Wish I could change your mind
I wish, I wish

(Oh, I wish, oh)
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Wish I could change your mind
I wish, I wish

I think of you every day, every night
You said you needed space and you needed time
I want you to know what I did wasn't right
Wish I could change your mind
I wish, I wish
