So, I got my boots on
Got the right amount of leather
And I'm doing me up
With a black colored liner

And I'm working my strut
But I know it don't matter
All we need in this world is some love

There's a thin line
'Tween the dark side
And the light side
Baby, tonight

It's a struggle
Gotta rumble
Tryin'a find it

But if I had you
That would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah, if I had you
The money, fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you
Life would be a party. It'd be ecstasy
Yeah, if I had you
Y-y-y-y-you y-y-y-y-y-you y-y-y-y-y-you
If I had you

From New York to LA getting high, rock-and-rolling
Get a room trash it up 'til it's ten in the morning
Girls in stripper heels, boys rolling in Maseratis
What they need in this world is some love

There's a thin line
'Tween the wild time
And a flat-line
Baby, tonight

It's a struggle
Gotta rumble
Tryin'a find it

But if I had you
That would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah, if I had you
The money, fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you
Life would be a party. It'd be ecstasy
Yeah, if I had you
Y-y-y-y-you y-y-y-y-y-you y-y-y-y-y-you
If I hadâ€”

The flashing of the lights
It might feel so good
But I got you stuck on my mind
Yeah
The fashion and the stage
It might get me high
But it don't mean a thing tonight

That would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah, if I had you
The money, fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you
Life would be a party. It'd be ecstasy
Yeah, if I had you
Y-y-y-y-you y-y-y-y-y-you y-y-y-y-y-you

If I had you
That would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah, if I had you
The money, fame and fortune never could compete
(Never could compete with you)
If I had you
Life would be a party. It'd be ecstasy
(It'd be ecstasy with you)
Yeah, if I had you
Y-y-y-y-you y-y-y-y-y-you y-y-y-y-y-you
If I had you
