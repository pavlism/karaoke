Losing faith will always get the best of me
Broken hope is treating me so carelessly
The way you seem to live so effortless
Builds the walls around the emptiness

You never, you never seem to notice

Over and over again, we struggle
Over and over again, so heavy is the heart
Over and over again, we struggle
We're wilting in the light and we stumble in the dark

We stumble in the dark

Promises have always been the worst for me
Wanting more will always be a mystery
Make your peace and never make a sound
Losing more will only tear us down

You never, you never seem to notice

Over and over again, we struggle
Over and over again, so heavy is the heart
Over and over again, we struggle
We're wilting in the light and we stumble in the dark

In the dark

Over and over again
Over and over again

Over and over again, we struggle
Over and over again, so heavy is the heart
Over and over again, we struggle
We're wilting in the light and we stumble in the dark
