One by one, brought to the sacrifice
With steel I will take every life
Shadows and dust, on a crimson sand
Man against man, fighting for victory
A clash of titans you will see
Born to die, honor and blood

We want it – we burn it
Feel the cold bite of steel in my hand

I am gladiator – king of the burning sand
I am gladiator – are you entertained?
I am gladiator – king of the burning sand
I rule the crowd, I own this world
Vengeance is mine

Clash of steel – blood, sweat and men will die
I kill them with a silent cry
This is my day – my last farewell
To the last breath, till the last tear is shed
I spill the blood and crack the heads
Darkness awaits, heroes will die

We want it – we burn it
Feel the cold bite of steel in my hand

I am gladiator – king of the burning sand
I am gladiator – are you entertained?
I am gladiator – king of the burning sand
I rule the crowd, I own this world
Vengeance is mine

My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.

I am gladiator
I am gladiator
I am gladiator – king of the burning sand
I am gladiator – are you entertained?

I am gladiator – king of the burning sand
I am gladiator – are you entertained?
I am gladiator – king of the burning sand
I rule the crowd, I own this world
Vengeance is mine
