I should've told you that I wanted you for me

You make it really hard to sleep
You keep me up, baby, you're my adrenaline, ooh-ooh
Brought out this other side of me
You don't even know, controlling my whole anatomy, oh-oh

Fingers are holding you right at the edge
You're slipping out of my hands
Keeping my secrets all up in my head
I'm scared that you won't want me back

Oh, I dance to every song like it's about you
I drink till I kiss someone who looks like you
I wish that I was honest when I had you
I should've told you that I wanted you for me

I dance to every song like it's about you
I drink till I kiss someone who looks like you
I wish that I was honest when I had you
I should've told you that I wanted you for me

Yeah, yeah
I wanted you for me
I should've told you that I wanted you for me

I'm in this party just because
Tears in my cup, swallow it down to feel the rush, ooh-ooh
I'm on the other side of town
Spinning around, don't even know you let me down, I-I

Fingers are holding you right at the edge
You're slipping out of my hands
Keeping my secrets all up in my head
I'm scared that you won't want me back

Yeah, oh, I dance to every song like it's about you
I drink till I kiss someone who looks like you
I wish that I was honest when I had you
I should've told you that I wanted you for me

Innocent lovers
We hold onto one another
Let's rediscover
You are the one for me, oh

I dance to every song like it's about you
I drink till I kiss someone who looks like you
I wish that I was honest when I had you
I should've told you that I wanted you for me

I dance now around you
All these dreams looks like you
One kiss, wish I had you
I should've told you that I wanted you for me
