I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours, yours

9:05 in the evening
I'm all up in my feelings
I'm calling your phone 'cause I can't get enough
And I got work in the morning
Early, early in the morning
But who needs sleep when we're loving it up

Oh oh why'd I gotta do this the hard way?
My body wants to be in your arms, bae, baby
Something I'll regret in the morning
But I just can't resist when you're calling

I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours tonight
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in (Yours, yours, yours)
That's what I said when I called you on the phone tonight
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours

You know I sleep on the left side
If you sleep on the left side
I'll move to the right, yeah, I'd do it for you, oh oh
And I got work in the morning
Early, early in the morning
But who needs sleep when I'm rockin' with you

Oh oh why'd I gotta do this the hard way?
My body wants to be in your arms, bae, baby
Something I'll regret in the morning
But I just can't resist when you're calling

I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours tonight
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in (Yours, yours, yours)
That's what I said when I called you on the phone tonight
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours

I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours tonight
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in (Yours, yours, yours)
That's what I said when I called you on the phone tonight
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours

Ooh ooh
Know I need your love
Know I need your love
Yeah
Ooh ooh
Know I need your love
Know I need your love

Been way too long on the phone right now
What you saying, wanna roll right now
If you don't wanna be on your own right now
Ring my phone 'cause

I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours tonight
But I'd rather be in (Yours, yours, yours)
Oh whoa

I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours tonight
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in (Yours, yours, yours)
That's what I said when I called you on the phone tonight
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours

Been way too long on the phone right now
What you saying, wanna roll right now
If you don't wanna be on your own right now
Ring my phone 'cause

I got a bed, but I'd rather be in yours tonight
I got a bed, but I'd rather be in (Yours, yours, yours)
