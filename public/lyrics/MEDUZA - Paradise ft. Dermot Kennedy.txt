In the fading light, hearts collide
Shadows dance in the distance
Something just ain't right, I'm cold inside
Help me find what I'm missing

We're all scared to fly, still, we try
Learn to be brave, see the other side
Won't you lead me there? Have no fear
Close your eyes, find paradise

Oh, my, my, my
There's a thousand miles between you and I
Oh, my, my, my
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise

Oh, my, my, my
There's a thousand miles between you and I
Oh, my, my, my
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise

Oh (Paradise), oh, my, my, my
Oh (Paradise), oh, my, my, my
Oh (Paradise), oh, my, my, my
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise

When the dark has gone, the morning's won
We're gonna feel something different
It will set you free if you just tell me
Every secret, I'll listen

We're all scared to fly, still, we try
Learn to be brave, see the other side
Won't you lead me there? Have no fear
Close your eyes, find paradise

Paradise, paradise
Close your eyes, find paradise
Paradise, paradise
Close your eyes, find para

Oh, my, my, my
There's a thousand miles between you and I
Oh, my, my, my
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise

Oh, oh, my, my, my
Oh, oh, my, my, my
Oh, oh, my, my, my
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise
