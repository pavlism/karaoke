Hey there pilgrim
Anybody tell you you're sittin' in my chair?
Move

I'm the John Wayne of the rap game
You suckers had a tool, I want it back mane
You ain't supposed to do it like that mane
That's whack, that's lame, cock back, bang
I'm the John Wayne of the rap game
You suckers had a tool, I want it back mane
You ain't supposed to do it like that mane
That's whack, that's lame, cock back, bang

Somebody's gotta do it baby, why not me?
I don't know who lied to you but y'all ain't Gs
Fourth down and a couple yards left
I hope you motherfuckers don't run out of breath
Fight to the death
Reputation on the line every time
They told me to relax but I don't know how
I got back on my grind and I ain't slowin' down
Treat a hater like pine straw and let 'em fuel the fire
Shit, [?] just to get it in
Tell the paparazzi come and get a flick
Papa's tell you how to do it super big
Super duper sick, fast fueler bitch, hooligan
Who is this? Who he think he is?
Rap game John Wayne
Cock back, bang on the lane
Ain't no disrespect, makin' sure you know the name
'Cause after this shit drop it won't ever be the same
Mane, mane

I'm the John Wayne of the rap game
You suckers had a tool, I want it back mane
You ain't supposed to do it like that mane
That's whack, that's lame, cock back, bang
I'm the John Wayne of the rap game
You suckers had a tool, I want it back mane
You ain't supposed to do it like that mane
That's whack, that's lame, cock back, bang

I'ma smack you in your head like your daddy
Ride around town in a camo wrapped Caddy
Country rap at us
Finest motherfucker talk shit all you gotta do is tell me where's the addy
I'ma pull up like an Uber and my dude ridin' shotgun is a shooter
And he kinda stupid, gotta couple screws loose
He been ridin' with me since we were drinkin' Kool Aid and eatin' Ramen Noodles
Same guy with me since we were at the bottom
Barely made it through school, never went to college
Whole bunch of hot heads, never was the loudest
Now I sell out shows and I'm always where the crowd is
How's it I don't ever walk with security?
Who the fuck murderin' me? (Motherfucker)
I don't fear no man, no hand gonna touch the damn hair on my head
You gon' end up dead mane, mane
