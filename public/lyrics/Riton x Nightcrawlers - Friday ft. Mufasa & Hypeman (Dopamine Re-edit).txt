I thought the hands of time would change me
And I'd be over this by now, yeah
It's been too long since we got crazy
I'm lowkey spinnin' out

I'm counting down till Friday come
I'm gonna, I'm gonna do too much
Know I'm all in my bag, that's clutch
Feelin' it, feelin' it, feelin' it
Every Friday, Saturday, Sunday
Endless weekend, on a wave, yeah

It's Friday then
It's Saturday, Sunday, what?

It's Saturday, Sunday, what? (We want that weekend)
It's Friday then (Ah)

This can't be bad for me, cause I want more
Wanna feel that bass vibrating through the floor
So keep it playing, I'm on a wave
And I'ma ride it all the way, when it comes like

We want that weekend (Again-gain-gain)
