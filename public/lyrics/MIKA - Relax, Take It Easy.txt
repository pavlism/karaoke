Took a ride to the end of the line where no one ever goes
Ended up on a broken train with nobody I know
But the pain and the longing's the same when you're dying
Now I'm lost and I'm screaming for help alone

Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you

It's as if I'm scared
It's as if I'm terrified
It's as if I scared
It's as if I'm playing with fire
Scared
It's as if I'm terrified
Are you scared?
Are we playing with fire?

Relax, oh, there is an answer to the darkest times
It's clear we don't understand it
But the last thing on my mind is to leave you
I believe that we're in this together
Don't scream, there are so many roads left

Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you

Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you

Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you

Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you

Relax

It's as if I'm scared
It's as if I'm terrified
It's as if I scared
It's as if I'm playing with fire
Relax
It's as if I'm terrified
Are you scared?
Are we playing with fire?

Relax
