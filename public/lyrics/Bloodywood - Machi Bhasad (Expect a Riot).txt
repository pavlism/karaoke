It's a fight that goes beyond bad or good
It's a fight between can and should
So bounce to the sound make a revolution
This is an act of war, this is the evolution

Remember those who raged before
We're the last straw
Hard to the core and we're ready for more
Rise up!

And get on the attack
Become the generation to break the camel's back!
Said, break the camel's back!
Said, break the camel's back!

Rise up!
And get on the attack
Become the generation to break the camel's back!

Tere bhrasht buddhi ke dhoke
Kab tak sahey, chup hoke
Jab belagaam pe de lagaam tu roke oye

Machi bhasad, dekh
Machi bhasad, dekh
Beech sadak teri machi bhasad, dekh
Khode milke teri kabar, bas

Khatm hua dekh mera sabar
Machi bhasad, dekh
Machi bhasad, dekh
Beech sadak teri machi bhasad, dekh

Khode milke teri kabar, bas
Khatm hua dekh mera sabar

"Hey there hi, I'm ready to die!"
The rare kind of guy who's willing to try
To take the big shots at the big boys
Boom boom bang, make a big noise

Shake it up I got the big toys
Ride with us we're the best of the rest
Grab the power by the neck and put it to the test
No flag on my bulletproof vest

Talk to my heart so I never gotta guess
Hear those who came before
Fear what is yet to come
Know what you're fighting for
It's why we go to war!

Tere bhrasht buddhi ke dhoke
Kab tak sahey, chup hoke
Jab belagaam pe de lagaam tu roke oye

Machi bhasad, dekh
Machi bhasad, dekh
Beech sadak teri machi bhasad, dekh
Khode milke teri kabar, bas

Khatm hua dekh mera sabar
Machi bhasad, dekh
Machi bhasad, dekh
Beech sadak teri machi bhasad, dekh

Khode milke teri kabar, bas
Khatm hua dekh mera sabar

Tere bhrasht buddhi ke dhoke
Kab tak sahey, chup hoke
It's a fight that goes beyond bad or good
It's a fight that goes beyond bad or good

Tere bhrasht buddhi ke dhoke
Kab tak sahey, chup hoke
Jab belagaam pe de lagaam tu roke oye

Machi bhasad, dekh
Machi bhasad, dekh
Beech sadak teri machi bhasad, dekh
Khode milke teri kabar, bas

Khatm hua dekh mera sabar
Machi bhasad, dekh
Machi bhasad, dekh
Beech sadak teri machi bhasad, dekh

Khode milke teri kabar, bas
Khatm hua dekh mera sabar
