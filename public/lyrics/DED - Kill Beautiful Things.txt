I kill all of the beautiful things
I kill all of the beautiful things
I kill all of the beautiful things
To keep me alive

I'm a face, I'm a name
I'm nothing like you are
How you love, just enough
So cunning, why am I still breathing?

So bite your tongue before you speak
'Cause there's no one saying anything
When all I want is something new
To make me numb

I kill all of the beautiful things
To keep me alive
 in a world so cold
I kill all of the beautiful things
To help me survive
can you save my soul?
'Cause I'm on my hands and knees
Praying up to nothing
All of the beautiful things
I kill all the beautiful things

I'm asleep, I'm awake
I'm not here, am I dreaming?
Of a life with a cure
For this place, oh it's picture perfect

I bite my tongue before I speak
'Cause there's no point in saying anything
We're so far gone, it's nothing new
So make me numb

I kill all of the beautiful things
To keep me alive
 in a world so cold
I kill all of the beautiful things
To help me survive
can you save my soul?
'Cause I'm on my hands and knees
Praying up to nothing
All of the beautiful things
I kill all the beautiful things

So leave me in silence, it holds me, I'm dying
I hate this, I hate this whole thing

I kill all pf the beautiful things
I kill all of the beautiful things

I kill all of the beautiful things
To keep me alive in a world so cold
I kill all of the beautiful things
To help me survive, can you save my soul?
'Cause I'm on my hands and knees
Praying up to nothing
All of the beautiful things
I kill all the beautiful things
I kill all the beautiful things
I kill all the beautiful things

All of the beautiful things
To keep me alive
