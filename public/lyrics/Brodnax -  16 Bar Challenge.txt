Bitch I ain't above you
I ain't below you
I'm right on the side of you baby
We gonna take this 16 bar challenge bitch
We gonna elevate it
We gonna go to the studio
We gonna shoot a visual
We gonna make this bitch bigger bitch

They really don't know me
They know they can't hold me
the one and the only they call it mojit
I come from the bottom
say get them I got them as soon I spot them
get swept off your feet

hit it with a blah blah chicka chicka pop pop
I show you how to run a mother fuckin 16
What's the robot briscoe on the mother fuckin beat
Bitch you put us together when you want some heat
They say I'm too country they say I'm to street
Bitch I'm and Gengis Johyn

Real and even real no more they are lying and putting it on god
Talking all the certified gangster shit bitch until he get hit with the bomb
I'd rather be humble and kind respecting the crime
If we praying for peace but we ready for war
Look a man in his eyes and I speak from the heart
that's the real definition of heart

I terrorize one of these cornball rappers
your free from the soul bitch you worse than your boss
I'm sicker than sars My mind is from mars
Bitch we are not from the same planet
connect with the spirit so demon they fear it
be weary of men that don't respect their families damit

Bitch coolest white boy I've ever seen
son of bitch mean jean
Patricia's son john
calling us to get er done

boy Somthing Somthing Somthing

He been doing this rapture since he was a baby 
and now that boy living his dream
If you put in the work and believe in yourself
see that bitch you can do anything
