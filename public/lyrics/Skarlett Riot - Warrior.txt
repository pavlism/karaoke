How did you sleep, how did you feel
When you attacked me
I can't believe, you didn't see
How cruel you could be
Those sleepless nights inside my head
No one there to save me
But you're so weak to corner me
Now I can see clearly

I'm stronger than before
I'm not afraid
To face the enemies
A warrior
I'm braver than before
I'm not afraid
To face the world alone
Warrior

You raised a fist to me
Spat right at me
So everyone could see
I felt so worthless
Time passes by, I realise
You're just a bully
What have I done, so damn wrong
Who will miss you when you're gone?

I'm stronger than before
I'm not afraid
To face the enemies
A warrior
I'm braver than before
I'm not afraid
To face the world alone
Warrior

I hold my head up high
Shine a light
Warrior
I won't look back, it's over now
I hold my head up high
Shine a light
Warrior
I won't look back, it's over now

You started a war
You've been defeated
You started a war

I am a warrior
You started a war
Warrior
You started a war
