Let the world think whatever the hell it wants
Let 'em plot their wicked ways
You’re free from falsehood
And brave in the heart
And your spirit can't be tamed
Yeah, it's never easy
To go against the grain
But you’re strong as a beast
And you fight like a storm
Till you win the final say

'Cause you are a true believer
Battling the curse
Fear no evil
Let your flames of fury burn
Fighting like a true believer
Man against the world
Fear no evil
They will reap what they have sown

You took the fall and all the beatings
Got the dirt thrown at your face
You were buried alive while
The lies spread around
In a preposterous parade
But the truth will rise from the shadows
Revelation carved in stone
It's a newborn resurrection
A declaration of war

'Cause you are a true believer
Battling the curse
Fear no evil
Let your flames of fury burn
Fighting like a true believer
Man against the world
Fear no evil
They will reap what they have sown
True believer
Battling the curse
Fear no evil
Let your flames of fury burn
Burn, burn, burn

'Cause you are a true believer
Battling the curse
Fear no evil
Let your flames of fury burn
Fighting like a true believer
Man against the world
Fear no evil
They will reap what they have sown
