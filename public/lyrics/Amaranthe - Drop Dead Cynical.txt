Drop dead cynical

I need attention, feed on my addiction
I want the action, satisfaction
You have to feed me words that I inquire
So my discord someday takes me higher

I hope to thrill you let expectations rise
I want to bring you somewhere you can't compromise
I'm coming at you like a cannonball
So here's the truth - you are drop dead cynical

Welcome to a new world
Open up the gates to paradise
So let's get cynical
Fall into a new maze
Open up your eyes
And soon we're all
We're drop dead cynical

Drop dead cynical

It's your illusions, fatal contradiction
I need the action, premonition
I like to thrill you, I am what inspire
Let you explode in a cosmic fire

You're Diogenes
Enlightened Zeon's mind
Ten times a cynic
As the man behind the shine
You make it hard
To justify it all
See what you are
You are drop dead cynical

Welcome to a new world
Open up the gates to paradise
So let's get cynical
Fall into a new maze
Open up your eyes
And soon we're all
We're drop dead cynical

Drop dead cynical

I hope to thrill you let expectations rise
I want to bring you somewhere you can't compromise
I'm coming at you like a cannonball
So here's the truth - you are drop dead cynical

Welcome to a new world
Open up the gates to paradise
So let's get cynical
Fall into a new maze
Open up your eyes
And soon we're all
We're drop dead cynical
