On this godforsaken planet
Smoke and death in the opal mines
Nuclear war-torn cities fill your sight
Oh, it's a world of sadistic killers
Men are tortured as they die

Is there a savior
Who can turn the tide

All our lives are on the line
We need a hero - Hero!
Unknown avenger from afar
He's the chosen one
The savior of the people - Hero!
From sorrow's land our bleeding hearts
Cry out for a hero

In the heat of revolution
Blood runs everywhere
For a brighter future's sake
We dream and dare
It is the hour of retribution
End of dark despair

Godsent avenger
Electrifies the air

All our lives are on the line
We need a hero - Hero!
The seven scars and fists of fury
He's the chosen one
The savior of the people - Hero!
From sorrow's land our bleeding hearts
Cry out...

All our lives are on the line
We need a hero - Hero!
Unknown avenger from afar
He's the chosen one
The savior of the people - Hero!
From sorrow's land our bleeding hearts
Cry out...

All our lives are on the line
We need a hero - Hero!
The seven scars and fists of fury
He's the chosen one
The savior of the people - Hero!
From sorrow's land our bleeding hearts
Cry out for a hero
