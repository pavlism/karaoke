All That Time On Your Own With Me
We Had Fun On The Three Sixty
I Helped You Get A Uav
Still Couldn’t Never Get You That A.C
Sicking In School Just To Get By You
I M Obsessed With This Scent On You
Coco Chanel On Your Neck With Your Body In Check
Loving All The Time With You

But Now You’ve Just Gone Missing
And You’re Airin All My Wishes
You’re Online But Still Won’t Listen
All My Time Is You Dismissing

This Is No Way A Two Way Street
I’m Playin’ Sad And It’s On Repeat
God Me In Hope When You See My Snap
‘Coz I’m Not Ready For Us To Wrap No Woah
