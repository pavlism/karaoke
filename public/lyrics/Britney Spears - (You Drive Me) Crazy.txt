Crazy
Oh, oh

Baby, I'm so into you
You got that something, what can I do?
Baby, you spin me around, oh
The earth is moving, but I can't feel the ground
Every time you look at me
My heart is jumping, it's easy to see

You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Whoa, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night

Tell me you're so into me
That I'm the only one you will see
Tell me I'm not in the blue, oh
That I'm not wasting my feelings on you
Every time I look at you
My heart is jumping, what can I do

You drive me crazy, I just can't sleep
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Whoa, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night

You drive me crazy
oh sing it
stop

You drive me crazy
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Whoa, my body feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night

You drive me crazy, (I just can't sleep)
I'm so excited, I'm in too deep
Whoa, crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night

sing it
crazy crazy crazy

You drive me crazy, but it feels alright
Baby, thinking of you keeps me up all night
