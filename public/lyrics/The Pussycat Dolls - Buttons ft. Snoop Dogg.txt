Come holla at me, you got it like that

You look at me and I look at you

I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons baby (Uh huh)
But you keep frontin' (Uh)
Saying what you gon' do to me (Uh Huh)
But I ain't seen nothing (Uh)

[Verse 1:]
Typical
Hardly the type I fall for
I like when the physical
Don't leave me asking for more

Who knows just how to get what I wanna (Wanna)
What I want to do is spring this on ya (On ya)
Back up all of the things that I told ya (Told ya, told ya, told ya)

You been sayin' all the right things all night long
But I can't seem to get you over here to help take this off

And the heat coming from this beat (Beat)
I'm about to blow

[Verse 2:]
You say you're a big boy
But I can't agree
'Cause the love you said you had
Ain't been put on me

If I'm just too much for you
Wonder (Wonder)
If my kiss don't make you just
Wonder (Wonder)

What you want to do? (Do)

Take a chance to recognize that this could be yours
I can see, just like most guys, that your game don't please
