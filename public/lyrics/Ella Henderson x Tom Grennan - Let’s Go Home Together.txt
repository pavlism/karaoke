I'd never have given you a second look
But I like the way you don't give a damn
You seem like someone I could
Pick fight with and dance all night with
Maybe you'll like me the way I am

And even though you got bad tattoos
And smell like booze, I'm into you
And even though you got an attitude
Baby, I'm in love

I've said a little too much
I'm a little bit drunk
Feels like I know you so well
You could be everything
That I've been missing
I'm coming out of my shell
I never do that
How did you do that?
It's like I've known you my whole life
So what, we're a little drunk
Let's go home together
Yeah, yeah, yeah

It's like I've known you my whole life
So what, we're a little drunk
Let's go home together
Yeah
Let's go home together

I'm a little drunk, need a little love
Could be everything that I've been missing
(You could be everything to me)
I'm a little drunk, need a little love
Could be everything that I've been missing
(Baby, I'm in love)

I've said a little too much
I'm a little bit drunk
Feels like I know you so well
You could be everything
That I've been missing
I'm coming out of my shell
I never do that
How did you do that?
It's like I've known you my whole life
So what, we're a little drunk
Let's go home together
(Home)
Let's go home together

I'd never have given you a second look
But I like the way you don't give a...
