{Pause30}Don't know where I'm going
Everybody's running, everybody's running
Come back after all is broken
Everything is burning, no one is returning

Step back, step back, everybody step back, step back
It's time to pick up the slack, the slack, you ought to know

Save me from this wicked person I've become
As the world comes crashing

Don't know why I'm crawling
Everybody's running, everybody's running
Re-spun back to where there's something
Everything was falling, trust in what was nothing

Step back, step back, everybody step back, step back
It's time to pick up the slack, the slack, you ought to know

Save me from this wicked person I've become
As the world comes crashing
Save me from this wicked person I've become
As the world comes crashing

Save me from this wicked person I've become
As the world comes crashing
Save me from this wicked person I've become
As the world comes crashing
Save me from this wicked person I've become
As the world comes crashing
