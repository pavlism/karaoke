I backed my car into a cop car the other day
Well, he just drove off, sometimes life's okay
I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh, what did I say?
Well, you just laughed it off, it was all okay

And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on anyway, well

A fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam
It was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand
Bad news comes, don't you worry even when it lands
Good news will work its way to all them plans
We both got fired on exactly the same day
Well, we'll float on, good news is on the way

Bring it on, here we are, win or lose, win or lose
Win or lose, win or lose, win or lose, win or lose
Win or lose, win or lose, I can't say

And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, alright

Already, we'll all float on
No, don't you worry, we'll all float on, alright
Already, we'll all float on, alright
Don't worry, we'll all float on

(Alright, already) And we'll all float on
Alright, already, we'll all float on, alright
Don't worry, even if things end up a bit too heavy
We'll all float on
Alright, already, we'll all float on (I'm told don't function and listen everyday)
Alright, already, we'll all float on (The worlds' still going strong)
Okay, don't worry, we'll all float on (I lose hair)
Even if things get heavy, we'll all float on (while living here)
Alright, already, we'll all float on (Alright!) (float on)
Now don't you worry, we'll all float on (Alright!)
We'll all float on
