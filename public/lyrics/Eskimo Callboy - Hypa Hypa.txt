Hypa hypa
You're pretty and I like ya
Move your body, girl
All night long
Hypa hypa
You're pretty and I like ya
You're gonna be my girl
All night long

There's a fire on the floor
Anytime you hit the club
Your body moves hypnotize me
God, I want it!
You are my drug
You're everything I want
I would give my soul
For a girl like you at once

Put your hands up!
And let me see you shake your hips
Medicate me!
I want that juice on your lips
Yeah you like that!
I wanna know that it's true
You're dancing for me
And I'm living for you

And I can't look away
I'm addicted to your smile
Dance for me! Dance!
Never stop girl
God, I love it!
You are my drug
You make my dreams come true
I would give my life
For a pretty girl like you

Put your hands up!
And let me see you shake your hips
Medicate me!
I want that juice on your lips
Yeah you like that!
I wanna know that it's true
You're dancing for me
And I'm living for you

You're alone on the dancefloor, baby

Getting closer to you

Imma break down the floor

Baby, can you see my moves
You're gonna love it!
