Coming on to the light of day
We got many moons that are deep at play
So I keep an eye on the shadow smile
To see what it has to say

You and I both know
Everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?

Spinning Knot that is on my heart
Is like a bit of light in a touch of dark
You got sneak attack from the zodiac
But I see your fire spark

Eat the breeze and go
Blow by blow and go away
Oh, what do you say?

Yeah

You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
And tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Stumble down to the parking lot
You got no time for the afterthought
They're like ice cream for an astronaut
Well, that's me looking for we

Turn the corner and
Find the world at your command
Playing the hand

Yeah

You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design

Do you want this love of mine?
Darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it? Do you want it now?

Do you want it all the time?
But darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it? Do you want it now?

Ah, pick you up like a paper back
With the track record of a maniac
So I move it in and we unpack
It's the same as yesterday

Any way we roll
Everything must go away
Oh, what do you say?

Yeah

You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky and
Dark necessities are part of my design
