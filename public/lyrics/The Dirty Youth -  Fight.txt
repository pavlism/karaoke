Don't wanna go there, I've had a late night
I'm feeling nauseous, chemicals enter my brain
I'm a control freak, an internet geek
I get these cravings, to get out and escape

You know that it's fate, and now you can't see
You lose your conscience, and break the silence
The script is written, it's complicated
Oh, something's about to erupt

This time you've taken it too far
All I wanna do is fight, can't you see you're pushing me over
Control freak this is who you are
All I wanna do is fight, I get the urge to fight

I lose perception, don't wanna listen
Define the mess, and wait for you to try and explain
Is this addiction, or science fiction
The truth is out there, so get out and escape

Create distinction, to change your life now
Your private mission, open your vision
The script is written, this is corruption
Oh, something's about to erupt

This time you've taken it too far
All I wanna do is fight, can't you see you're pushing me over
Control freak this is who you are
All I wanna do is fight, can't you see you're pushing me over

I lose control

This time you've taken it too far
All I wanna do is fight, can't you see you're pushing me over
Control freak this is who you are
All I wanna do is fight, I get the urge to fight

This time you've taken it too far
All I wanna do is fight, can't you see you're pushing me pushing me
Control freak this is who you are
All I wanna do is fight, I get the urge to fight
