Watching you sitting there alone again
The pain is eating you alive
You're suffering
Wonder If I'll ever see you whole again
If I had just one wish, I'd take it all away

Don't let go
I'll find you in the darkness
I need you
Light up for me
Don't let go
I'll find you in the darkness
Never leave you
Light up for me

Open up, I'll be your light
Just let me in
I'd give it all just to hear your laughter again
You're the one, the only one that made me feel
I want it back, the light you had
Hold on to me!

Don't let go
I'll find you in the darkness
I need you
Light up for me
Don't let go
I'll find you in the darkness
Never leave you
Light up for me

I know the weight of the pain you feel
I'll share your burden, I'll help you heal

Don't let go
I'll find you in the darkness
I need you
Light up for me
Don't let go
I'll find you in the darkness
Never leave you
Light up for me
Light up for me
Light up for me
