I die to live, I live to love you endlessly
Your love is everything my heart desires to feel
I lie awake at night and dream of your return
Behind closed eyes I see you just the way you were

The diamond shatters and now I know
How much pain it causes when you're gone
All I can wish now's a miracle
Miracle to reawake our love

Do you remember the night we met?
Will we ever be the same again?
Inside the fire with my regrets
Wish I could be born again tonight

The sleeping death waits in the silence of my woe
A touch from you is all it takes to save my soon
To be dead soul

Love is a killer that never dies
Murdering its victim with delight
A long forgotten and sacrificed
Beggar in a barren paradise

Do you remember the night we met?
Will we ever be the same again?
Inside the fire with my regrets
Wish I could be born again tonight

Do you remember the night we met?
Will we ever be the same again?
Inside the fire with my regrets
Wish I could be born again tonight

Wish I could be born again
