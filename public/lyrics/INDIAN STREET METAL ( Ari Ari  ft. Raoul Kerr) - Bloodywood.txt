Raised in the land that's diversity defined
Raw and wild
Beautiful unrefined
Forged in the furnace that is the desi grind
Thaught to battle with my fists as much as my mind, said
WHOAAAAA
If you here you know
We got more drama than HBO
And fuck front row seats
We're the show
So step into the scene if you're ready to go
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Show us what you got
Are you ready now?
Show us what you go
Gonna show you what we got
We're Indian
So you know we make it hot
Wari warsi khatan gaya si
Khat ke liyanda patasa
Wari wari warsi khatan gaya si
Khat ke liyanda patasa
Ke mitra nu maar gaya
Maar gaya ve tera haasa
Ke mitra nu maar gaya
Maar gaya ve tera haasa

Ari ari ari
Ari ari ari
Ve teri meri ek jindadi
Le ke lut jind saari ki teri meri
Ari ari ari
Ari ari ari
Ve teri meri ek jindadi
Le ke lut jind saari ki teri meri
Ek jindadi

Make no mistake
This is an attack
Can't take it, won't take it
Now we bout to hit back
Click-clack, lock and load
Gotta hit the road
Enough is enough
Shit's about to get rough
You know it's bad when you gotta fight for peace
But the cure always needs
A bit of the disease
Came out swinging from the belly of the beast
Gonna bridge the gap between west and east
North and south
Main ain't no doubt
Gonna give them a war
Like never before
Hearts full of love saying "Fuck you, fool"
"Undivided we stand, together we rule!"
Wari warsi khatan gaya si

Hungry for a fight
But it never seemed to feel right
Then i found the good fight
The best fight
Redirected rage against the dying of the light
Set my sights, fire bars at will
Shot to kill, never gonna stand still
We fight the power that profits from the rift
Cause the desi boys know that diversity's a gift
And we wanna share it with our people world-wide
Cause the desi boys know that diversity's a gift

Ari ari ari
Ari ari ari
Ve teri meri ek jindadi
Le ke lut jind saari ki teri meri
Ari ari ari
Ari ari ari
Ve teri meri ek jindadi
Le ke lut jind saari ki teri meri
Ek jindadi
