[Lance:] It's gonna be me.

[Justin:] Oh, yeah.

[Justin:]
You might've been hurt, babe.
That ain't no lie.
You've seen them all come and go.
I remember you told me
That it made you believe in
"No man, no cry".
Maybe that's why

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you.
You don't wanna lose it again,
But I'm not like them.
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody,
Guess what?
It's gonna be me.

[JC:]
You've got no choice, babe,
But to move on. And you know
There ain't no time to waste.
You're just too blind (too blind) to see,
But in the end, you know it's gonna be me.
You can't deny.
So just tell me why

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you.
You don't wanna lose it again,
But I'm not like them.
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody (somebody),
Guess what (guess what)?
It's gonna be me.

[Lance:] It's gonna be me.
[Justin:] Ooh, yeah, yeah.

[Justin:]
There comes a day
When I'll be the one.
You'll see
It's gonna-gonna-gonna-gonna-gonnaâ€”
It's gonna be me.

All that I do
Is not enough for you.
I don't wanna lose it,
But I'm not like that.
When finally (finally)
You get to love,
Guess what (guess what)?

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you.
(For you, babe.)
You don't wanna lose it again,
(Don't wanna lose it.)
But I'm not like them.
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody,
(Love.)
Guess what (guess what)?
It's gonna be me.

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you.
You don't wanna lose it again,
(Don't wanna lose it.)
But I'm not like them.
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody,
Guess what (guess what)?

[Justin:] It's gonna be me.
