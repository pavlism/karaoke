Hear me
Nothing can stop the fire in the heart
Of the broken one
Fear me
If your destiny is linked to mine
One more time

I sing
Oh
Tonight I watch the stars align and
Oh
They tell me don't fall down

So I came back to life
One more time
I fought through the torments alone
Back from the abyss
My power awakened
The flames of Hell will have to wait

My sorrows
Killed and buried, now I harmonize
With the stars
I glow
In my darkness, not afraid to shine
Anymore

I sing
Oh
Tonight I write my name with fire and
Oh
I sentence my fears to die

So I came back to life
One more time
I fought through the torments alone
Back from the abyss
My power awakened
The flames of Hell will have to wait

Oh
Tonight I watch the stars
Oh
They tell me don't fall down

So I came back to life
And I fought through the torments alone
My dominion awaits
Eyes wide open

From Hell I came back to life
One more time
I fought through the torments alone
Back from the abyss
My power awakened
The flames of Hell will have to wait
